# backendDB

![backend](assert/backendDBpng.png)




## Preparation
### Setup Environment
```
conda create -n backend python==3.10 -y
conda activate backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Setup Milvus server

#### Requirement
Milvus server run on Docker server, please see these following links first:
1. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
2. https://milvus.io/docs/prerequisite-docker.md

#### Install Milvus
Download milvus-standalone-docker-compose.yml and save it as docker-compose.yml manually, or with the following command:
```
wget https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/download/v2.3.2/milvus-standalone-docker-compose.yml -O docker-compose.yml
```
#### Start Milvus
In the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file, start up Milvus by running:
```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Now check if same directory as the docker-compose.yml file has folder volumes, and run the following command:
```
sudo docker compose ps
```
Connect to Milvus through port:
```
docker port milvus-standalone 19530/tcp
```

## Test splitter
Open file `notebooks/test_splitter.ipynb` and select kernel (`backend` environment). Then, feel free to test ü¶ô

Some arguement need to test:
1. `separator`: str = " ",
2. `chunk_size`: int = 200,
4. `chunk_overlap`: int = 20,
5. `paragraph_separator`: str = "\n\n\n",
6. `secondary_chunking_regex`: str = "[^.„ÄÇÔºüÔºÅ]+[.„ÄÇÔºüÔºÅ]?"


## Usecase 
### normal case
Folder `examples/` has some usecases, generally split into three steps:
1. call `DirectoryReader` from `src.reader.dir_reader` and put list of file path to argument `input_files`
    - using `input_dir` (+ `num_files_limit` if loading limit files) to read files in that directory (set `recursive=True` if loadding nested folder)

2. initialize Hydra config and put into argument `config` of `ConfigurationManager`

3. Call class pipeline in folder `src.pipeline`, put config and run `main()` function. Currently only supporting pipeline for data ingestion.  

### runing law database
Law database is created by using csv files, only run the scripts below:
```
python examples/milvus_with_law.py
```

### gradio for visualzing retrieve and rerank result from retriever pipeline
Note that first query will consuming much time to load pipeline, connect database. This pipeline will be optimized to load when loading gradio (init) 
```
python deploy/deploy_gradio.py
```
